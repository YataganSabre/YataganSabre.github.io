<p>Howdy, I'm Kaan, I wasn't sure what to put here so I'm just going to chuck some images of models I've painted recently cuz I'm a narcassist and talk about them. Each other person's page will be something of their own personal interest as well.</p>

<p>This is a Voidraven Bomber, for the faction known as the Drukhari, which are essentially elves in space that never really left their goth phase and instead got far worse. It drops a massive bomb that kills you, as bombs do. It is over a foot long and eveytime I hold it I get the desire to long arm it at someone.</p>
<center><img src="redgat.jpg" alt="Redemptor Dreadnought" class="img"></center>
<p>This large lad is a Redemptor Dreadnought armed with a Heavy Onslaught Gatling Cannon, specifically for the Salamanders Space Marine chapter. It is a slowmoving mech that in its core holds the heavily damaged body of a Space Marine, no longer fit to serve in standard foot combat, is instead intured into the aptly named sarcophagus within the machine until the stress of the frame kills them. Good fun.</p>
<center><img src="disc.jpg" alt="Exalted on Disc" class="img"></center>
<p>This is a Exalted Sorcerer, specifically one mounted on a Disc of Tzeentch. They belong to a group known as the Thousand Sons, super human space marines whom have fallen to the Chaos god of Change, Tzeentch. <br>By serving them they gain great powers such as opening portals and casting literal hell fire, but with the small itty bitty side effect of perhaps being turned into a moving flesh bag if mutations go haywire. They look very pretty and take too long to paint.</p>
