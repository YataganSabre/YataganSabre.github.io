<h1>Welcome to Bernard's Page!</h1>
<p>Howdy, I'm Bernard! For my page, I figured I might as well throw in a bunch of anime I like to watch and maybe a gif to be fancy.</p>
<center><img src="YukiType.gif" alt="Yuki Typing"></center>
<p>This is from an anime called the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Despite the gifs I'm providing, the anime doesn't really have much to do with coding or computing, though one of the characters is quite good at hacking. Rather, the anime is about a girl who is unknowingly a god, except to a select circle around her. They have to make sure she doesn't blow up the world or have a major tantrum while also genuinely being her friends.</p>

<p>Anime isn't quite for everybody, but that's okay. Haruhi was the first major anime I ever watched by myself. Certainly, there had been other anime I watched with my brothers, and those certainly affected my future taste in anime, but there's something about doing something on your own for the first time. <br><br> Even if that's watching anime. <br><br> It was among the first major successes of Kyoto Animation and helped to break in regular Japanese Animation to 'mainstream' American audiences. <br> This would eventually lead to many more anime adaptations such as Lucky Star, Clannad, and K-On, all of which became internet phenomenon. In terms of recent anime, they've also been working on Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid and Violet Evergarden. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
